### Notes
- `dosage`, `frequency`, and `duration` are stored as **TEXT** for flexibility (e.g., `"400mg"`, `"Every 8 hours"`, `"As needed"`).
- You can send multiple diagnostics in one POST.
- `treatments` can be an empty array if no treatments are needed.
- GET always returns diagnostics **with** their treatments nested.
